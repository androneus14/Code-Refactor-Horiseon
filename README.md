# Code-Refactor-Horiseon

Our task was to improve on the code given to us and correct any mistakes and / or broken links that were in the file. The biggest changes to the html code were retitling several of the elements (header, footer, section, etc.) from the div element. While serving the same purpose, when viewing the html file, it now looks a lot cleaner and more easily decipherable between the elements. Because we changed some of the elements, the same changes had to be made to the linked css file so that the changes would still be implemented.

The first link, 'Search Engine Optimization' was also broken and has now been corrected.

Also added were alternate tags to each of the images for accessibility purposes.
